# New Change Report Generator

I created this program while working for customer company as a Mechanical Engineer, to avoid tedious process of manual hyperlink insertion in Word documents, during creation of report for Engineering Change.

## How it works
It gets as an input *.xlsx file generated by Siemens Teamcenter and on this basis generates Change Report in *.docx.

## Required libraries
DocumentFormat.OpenXml
