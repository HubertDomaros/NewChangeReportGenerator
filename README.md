# New Change Report Generator

I created this program while working for customer company as a Mechanical Engineer, to avoid tedious process of manual hyperlink insertion in Word documents, during creation of report for Engineering Change.

## How it works
It gets as an input *.xlsx file generated by Siemens Teamcenter, and basing on this Excel file generates table for Change Report in *.docx format in the way that was required by the customer.

## Required libraries
DocumentFormat.OpenXml
